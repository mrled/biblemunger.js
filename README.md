This is a rewrite of
[my old Python biblemunger project](https://github.com/mrled/biblemunger).

<https://biblemunger.micahrl.com>

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

This will deploy automatically on pushes to the master branch.
